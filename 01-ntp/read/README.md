The approach I took was basically just following what the commebnts in the file told me.
The code being seperated into groups was super helpful in helping me learn and understand what i was doing
and the detailed explainations on top of each functions were also really helpful. Buggest challenge I faced was
with the analysis questions. They really tested my knowledge and also forced me to expand by doing more research.
